# Nuclear Scare

Just a curiosity project to see the impact of Russia's scare tactics

## Data used

- I used NYT API because it went back over and beyond first use and popularization of Nuclear Energy and Nukes
- 36.4 GB worth of data in JSON format when fully downloaded
- I didn't focus on the context or bias
- Ended up only using 2009-present data since "Atomic" and "Nuclear" Keywords were not used before

## How and why?!? with Graphs

- Because of how much articles were in every single month it was most logical to me to simply focus on percentage of said articles per Month
- Most distinct difference was between keywords "Nuclear Energy" and "Nuclear Weapon" that ended up having different spikes in percentage
- Dotted black line is Standard Deviation (Why no legend on Graphs you might ask yourself?)

### All "Nuclear" and "Atomic" keywords

- The spike after the war started is slightly misleading because these were both Russians going trough Chernobyl and Kremlin clamouring with Nukes

### "Nuclear Energy"

- First spike was Fukushima which was the biggest spike

### "Nuclear Weapons"

- Now this one is interesting because there is all sorts of keywords that it can come with ("Nuclear Tests", "North Korea", "Iran", etc.)
- I didn't go into what all those spikes were but I am going to speculate that it also could have been Trump wanting to nuke hurricane

## Conclusions?

-One of the reasons that I did this was that amount of "news" containing words "Nuclear" and "Fallout" and similar s**t trying to be idk clickbaity or scary. I know that the amount of Russia's nuke threats could have been overplayed on the media that I was seeing or my own hyperfocus on them. Anyway this was fun little 35GB experiment. The ? is for you to draw your own conclusions, if any! P.S. why are you reading this?
